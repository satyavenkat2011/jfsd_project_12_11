JFS Project
I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed the JFSD (Java Full Stack Development) project. This repository contains the backend code, demonstrating robust functionality and integration for the project requirements.

Note on Frontend Access
For some reason, the frontend folder is inaccessible in this repository. To overcome this, I have created a separate repository that contains the frontend code(Admin Module). You can access it using the following link:
[Frontend Repository Link](https://github.com/satyavenkat2011/frontend) (Replace # with the actual URL of the frontend repository)

Let me know if you need additional edits! Would you like this formatted for immediate Git usage
